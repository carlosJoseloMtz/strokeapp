# strokeapp
Testing and clearing the code for the stroke rehab application built in python

# About the project

This is version 2.0 from one of my school projects:
"Sistema de Realidad Aumentada para la Rehabilitación después de una apoplejía",
which basically means that is an application that will -help- assist people who are recovering from a stroke.
Back then, when we built the software, we also used python but we were limited to use Panda3D and ArToolkit
-and I didn't like it that much-.

# Why we are building this project -again-
Because it's fun and we can.

# Instructions

This application uses python 2.7, why? Because that's the one I had already installed on my local environment
when I first started the development.

We run opencv library for python, I think it's version 2 # TODO: clarify this

As you can see, this is not clean and clever code, most of the work has been done in just one single session so please
DO NOT freak out when reading the code,

Also, I am not native English speaker so do not make fun at something I wrote incorrectly, your help correcting anything
will be more than welcome,
